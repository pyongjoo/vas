title: A Quick Example

To aid illustration, we used VAS to sample only 1000 points out of more than 2
billion data points, and visulized those points using a scatter plot below. You
can see that, even though it is showing only a tiny fraction of the original
dataset **(less than 0.0005% !!!)**, it maintains many important structures of
the original dataset; thus, we can grasp that the data points mainly reside on
the continents of the world.

For comparison, we also visualize below the same number of data points (1000)
obtained from a uniform random sampling. The time it takes for visualizing the
data is almost identical (since the number of the data points is equal as 10K in
both cases); however, they produce significantly different results.
