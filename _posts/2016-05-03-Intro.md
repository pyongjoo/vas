title: Big Data, Poor Latency
---

You have billions of data points, but are you frustrated simply because they are
just **too big** to visualize? This is a common problem we encounter when we
work with large database: my dataset is **simply too big** to interactively explore
and gain useful insights from them.

Our proposed approach, Visualizaion-Aware Sampling (VAS), makes **the
interactive visulization of big data** possible by reducing the number of data
points, but *minimzing* the quality loss stemming from the data reduction
process.

To aid illustration, we used VAS to sample only 1,000 points out of more than 2
billion data points, and visulized those points using a scatter plot below. You
can see that, even though it is showing only a tiny fraction of the original
dataset **(less than 0.0005% !!!)**, it maintains many important structures of
the original dataset; thus, we can grasp that the data points mainly reside on
the continents of the world.
